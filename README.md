# release

This release project is designed for end user on purpose.
As the otdd project contains many different kind of parts working together so they are scattered to many different sub projects, which makes the end user hard to organize and understand.
This release project contains:

- *installation scripts*. the scripts to install/uninstall otdd by executing single script.
- *otddctl.sh*. the command line script to use the otdd.
- *examples*. the otdd examples to explore what otdd provide.

You can just download them from the releases tab and start using otdd!
